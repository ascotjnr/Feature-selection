# Feature-selection
Feature Selection is a critical data preprocessing step in machine learning which is an effective way in removing irrelevant variables thus reducing the dimensionality of input features. Removing uninformative — or even worse, misinformative — input columns helps to train a machine learning model on a more generalised data with better performances on new and unseen data. In this repository, eight feature selection techniques paired with the gradient boosting regressor model were evaluated based on the statistical comparison of their prediction errors and computational efficiency in reservoir characterisation.
